# Ruby Stock Picker Project

## Project Overview
I'm proud to introduce the "Ruby Stock Picker" project, an integral part of the "Basic Ruby Projects" section from the "Ruby" course in the "Full Stack Ruby on Rails" path of The Odin Project. This project is a testament to my growing skills in Ruby, particularly in array manipulation and algorithmic problem-solving.

As I continue to explore the vast landscape of Ruby, my goal for this project is not just to create a functional stock picker method but also to ensure the code is efficient, robust, and well-documented, setting a strong foundation for future enhancements.

## Key Learning Objectives
With this project, I aim to showcase my expertise in:

- **Array Manipulation**: Gaining hands-on experience in processing arrays to extract meaningful insights.
- **Algorithm Development**: Demonstrating my ability to design and implement algorithms that can effectively analyze and provide solutions based on input data.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Ensuring the method is resilient and can handle various edge cases, providing accurate results consistently.
- **Git & GitHub Usage**: Continuously refining my skills in using Git and GitHub for version control, emphasizing regular commits and detailed documentation of code changes.

## Project Description
The primary task is to implement a method named `#stock_picker` that:

1. Accepts an array of stock prices, each representing a hypothetical day.
2. Returns a pair of days indicating the best day to buy and the best day to sell to maximize profit. Note that days start at 0.

For example:

```ruby
stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10])
# Expected output: [1,4]  # for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
```

##Quick Tips:
- Always remember: You need to buy before you can sell.
- Be mindful of edge cases, such as when the lowest day is the last day or the highest day is the first day.

##Getting Started

To bring this project to life, I followed these steps:

- **Repository Setup**: Initialized a GitHub repository to track the project's evolution.
- **Method Development**: Concentrated on the iterative development of the #stock_picker method, ensuring it meets the specified requirements and handles edge cases gracefully.
- **Testing**: Conducted rigorous testing to validate the method's accuracy and reliability.
- **Documentation**: Regularly updated the README and added inline comments to provide clarity on the code's functionality and logic.

##Conclusion

The "Ruby Stock Picker" project has been an enlightening experience, shedding light on the intricacies of algorithmic problem-solving in Ruby. As I progress with The Odin Project, I am enthusiastic about facing more challenges and further sharpening my skills in Ruby and software development overall.
